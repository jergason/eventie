Example code for threaded server
======================================================================

Contents:

1) Makefile - Will compile the code and keep track of dependencies, so
that the code is recompiled correctly when any of the source code is
modified.

2) server.cc - Echo server that uses a class instance to handle threads.

3) threaded.cc - Echo server that creates a thread per connection.

4) poller.cc - Echo server that uses the poll() system call to multiplex
   clients using one thread.

5) poller.cc - Echo server that uses the more efficient epoll() system
   call to multiplex clients using one thread.

6) client.cc - Echo client

Syntax:

Demonstrate non-threaded server:

./server -p 3000
./client -p 3000
./client -p 3000

Demonstrate threaded server:

./threaded -p 3001
./client -p 3001
./client -p 3001
