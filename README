Eventie
=======

###An event-drive web server in C++

##Useage

* Compile eventie with `make`.
* Make and run with `make run`.
* Make and run with debugging info enabled with `make run_debug`.

It should work out of the box by running `make run`. Note that
eventie depends on the "web.conf" file being in the same directory as the
binary.
